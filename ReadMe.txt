It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that parses JSON files of character movelists and displays them in Discord chat using embeds.

Invite the bot to your server using this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=302295833208946689&scope=bot&permissions=11264

Although core functionality is complete, this bot is still largely being rewritten, and will undergo changes as I get a better idea of what I'm doing.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4, FuzzyWuzzy, and DateUtils.

To run the bot, create a txt file in the same directory as tekkenbot.py, paste your token in it and name it token.txt. Then execute tekkenbot.py.


The goal of this fork is to get better frame data from http://geppopotamus.info/game/tekken7fr/
